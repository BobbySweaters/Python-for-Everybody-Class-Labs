# Built in functions - Python provides a number of important built-in functions that we 
# can use without needing to provide the function definition. 
# The creators of Python wrote a set of functions to solve common problems 
# and included them in Python for us to use.
# Examples of Built in Functions; min, max, print, sum, len, round, abs, sorted,
# int, type, float, str, random, and more...  
# 
# User defined functions -  Use the def command. This starts the definition of a function. 

big = max('Hello World') # big is the assignment. max is the built in function. 
# Hellow world is the argument
print(big) #print is also a built in function

tiny = min('Functions')
print(tiny)

#Type conversions

float(99) / 100
i = 42
type(i)
f = float(i)
